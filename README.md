## Notes

I had a lot of trouble with differences between the walkthrough UI's and the ones I have for android studio It made me go on a little bit of a goose chase to figure
out why my code was not committing correctly and why it did not look the same way the walkthroughs did. It honestly made me turn it in late. I had just heard about code path thanks to my school University of Maryland - College Park doing a resume review for out career fair that was sponsored from them. I would still love to be able to enroll in this course after hearing about all the things that I can do at these CodePath courses and how after seeing how intricate these walkthroughs are I learned so much about git, android studio, and kotlin in just a few short hours. I would love to be apart of this learning community.
